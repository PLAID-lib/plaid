Core concepts
=============

PLAID is a datamodel and library for organizing physics datasets and defining learning problems on these datasets.

It provides high-level classes such as {py:class}`~plaid.containers.dataset.Dataset`, {py:class}`~plaid.containers.sample.Sample`, and {py:class}`~plaid.problem_definition.ProblemDefinition`, with features addressed via {doc}`core_concepts/feature_identifiers`.

PLAID relies on the CGNS standard for representing complex physics meshes and uses human-readable formats like `.yaml`, `.csv` for other features.

For more details and examples, see the {doc}`core_concepts` and {doc}`notebooks` pages.
