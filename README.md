## 1. Description

This library proposes an implementation for a datamodel tailored for AI and ML learning of physics problems.
It has been developped at SafranTech, the research center of [Safran group](https://www.safran-group.com/).

- **Documentation:** https://plaid-lib.readthedocs.io/
- **Source code:** https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid
- **Contributing:** https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
- **License:** https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid/blob/main/LICENSE.txt
- **Bug reports:** https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid/issues
- **Report a security vulnerability:** https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid/issues

## 2. Getting started


### 2.1 Using the library

To use the library, the simplest way is to install the conda-forge or PyPi package:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge plaid
pip install pyplaid
```

### 2.2 Contributing to the library

To contribute to the library, you need to clone the repo using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid.git
```

Configure an environment manually following the dependencies listed in ``conda_dev_env.yml``, or generate it using conda:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_dev_env.yml
```

Then, to install the library:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To check the installation, you can run the unit test suite:

```bash
pytest tests
```

To test further and learn about simple use cases, you can run and explore the examples:

```bash
cd examples
bash run_examples.sh  # [unix]
run_examples.bat      # [win]
```

**Note**

[pytest](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytest) and [Muscat](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/muscat) are two dependencies not included in the packages ``plaid`` on conda-forge or ``pyplaid`` on PyPi, but required to run the tests and examples. [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) is available on PyPi, but not [Muscat](https://pypi.org/project/pytest).


## 3. Call for Contributions
