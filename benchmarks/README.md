## PLAID Benchmarks

This folder contains the code used to generate the baselines for the [PLAID Benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions), with the exception of the Augur results, which are produced using a [commercial solution](https://augurco.fr/). These benchmarks are interactive: anyone can participate by submitting their own model predictions. Each benchmark includes the corresponding dataset, along with documentation on how to use it and how to submit a solution.

**Additional notes:**
- **MMGP** does not support variable mesh topologies, which prevents its application to some datasets. However, when morphing is either unnecessary or inexpensive, it offers a highly efficient solution, combining fast training with good accuracy (e.g., `Tensile2d`, `Rotor37`).
- **MARIO** is computationally expensive to train but achieves consistently strong performance across most datasets. Its result on `2D_MultiScHypEl` is slightly higher than other top performers, which may reflect the challenge of capturing complex shape variability in that case.
- **Vi-Transformer** and **Augur** perform well across all datasets, showing strong versatility and generalization capabilities.
- **FNO** suffers significantly on datasets with strong mesh anisotropies: the projections to and from regular grids degrade accuracy, especially on datasets with strong mesh anisotropies such as `Rotor37` and `2D_profile`. Additionally, the use of a 3D regular grid on `Rotor37` results in substantial computational overhead.
